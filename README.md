# Heart Disease

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to investigate the association between different factors to the presence of heart disease. It will be useful for these significantly associated factors for further heart disease research.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scipy.stats 
* Statsmodels 

## Project Description
* The [source of heart disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) has been modified to 8 features.
* Investigate which features are significantly associated with the presence of heart disease.
* Exploratory data analysis of the central tendency of each variable in relation to presence of heart disease were investigated to check if there is any outliers or skewness of the data distribution.
* Data visualization using box plots to compare the median differences for patients with or without heart disease in relation to a specific feature.
* Hypothesis testing using two-sample t-test and ANOVA with Tukey's range test to test null and alternative hypothesis.


## Needs of this project
